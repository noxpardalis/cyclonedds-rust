/// A type that can be used as a DDS topic payload.
///
/// Implement this trait to register a type as a DDS topic payload. The derive
/// macro [`Topicable`](cyclonedds_derive::Topicable) handles the common case;
/// implement manually when you need control over the key type or type name.
///
/// # Keys
///
/// Every [`Topicable`] type has an associated [`Key`](Topicable::Key) type that
/// uniquely identifies an instance. For unkeyed topics, use any zero-sized type
/// as the key ([`()`](primitive@unit) being the straightforward choice), and
/// all samples will be treated as belonging to a single instance.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(
///     cyclonedds::Topicable, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize, Default, Clone, Debug,
/// )]
/// struct Temperature {
///     #[key]
///     sensor_id: u32,
///     value: f32,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Manual implementation:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize, Clone, Default, Debug)]
/// struct Temperature {
///     sensor_id: u32,
///     value: f32,
/// }
///
/// impl cyclonedds::Topicable for Temperature {
///     type Key = u32;
///
///     fn from_key(key: &u32) -> Self {
///         Self {
///             sensor_id: *key,
///             value: 0.0,
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn as_key(&self) -> u32 {
///         self.sensor_id
///     }

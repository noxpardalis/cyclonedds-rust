//! It is intended **only** for power users who understand the internal workings
//! of the library and need access to functionality beyond the public API.
//!
//! This module is only available when the `internal` feature is enabled.
//!

//! > ⚠️ **Warning:** Everything in this module is considered
//! > unstable and may change, break, or be removed without notice between versions.

//! [`QoS`](crate::QoS) policy types for entities.
//!
//! Each type in this module corresponds to a [`QoS`](crate::QoS) policy defined
//! in the DCPS specification. Policies are set on a [`QoS`](crate::QoS)
//! instance via its
//! `with_*` methods and applied to entities through their builders.
//! Some policies only apply to specific entity types; when applied
//! they cascade to the appropriate entities automatically.
//!
//! See to the [DDS specification] and the [Cyclone DDS documentation] for
//! the applicability and semantics of each policy.
